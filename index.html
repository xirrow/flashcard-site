        <span class="clickable">JavaScript (JS)</span>
        <div id="showing">
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as
                Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-b````ased, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
            </p>

            <p>The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which
                is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript
                2020.
            </p>

            <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have a very different syntax,
                semantic, and use.</p>

        <span class="clickable2">Operators</span>
        <div id="showing2">
            <p>An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces
                a result which is 3 in this case.</p>

        <span class="clickable3">Variables</span>
        <div id="showing3">
            <p>A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.</p>

        <span class="clickable4">Variable Naming Conventions</span>
        <div id="showing4">
            <ul>
                <li>You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name. These keywords are mentioned in the next section. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.</li>
            </ul>

        <span class="clickable5">Functions</span>
        <div id="showing5">
            <p>A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value.
                A function in JavaScript is also an object.</p>

            <p>A function name is an identifier included as part of a function declaration or function expression. The function name's scope depends on whether the function name is a declaration or expression.</p>

        <br>

        <span class="clickable6">Methods</span>
        <div id="showing6">
            <p>A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kind of methods: Instance Methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or Static Methods which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.
            </p>
            <div id="hidden6"><span class="clickable6">Hide Information</span></div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <span class="clickable7">Arguments</span>
        <div id="showing7">
            <p>An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.</p>
            <div id="hidden7"><span class="clickable7">Hide Information</span></div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <span class="clickable8">Parameters</span>
        <div id="showing8">
            <p>A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
            </p>

            <p>Note the difference between parameters and arguments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.</li>
                <li>Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.</li>
                <li>Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Two kinds of parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>input parameters
                    </p>
                    <p>the most common kind; they pass values into functions. Depending on programming language, input parameters can be passed several ways (e.g., call-by-value, call-by-address, call-by-reference).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>output/return parameters
                    </p>
                    <p>primarily return multiple values from a function, but not recommended since they cause confusion</p>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <span class="clickable9">Return</span>
        <div id="showing9">
            <p>The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.</p>

        <span class="clickable10">Chaining Methods</span>
        <div id="showing10">
            <p>Method chaining eliminates an extra variable for each intermediate step. The developer is saved from the cognitive burden of naming the variable and keeping the variable in mind.</p>

            <p>Method chaining has been referred to as producing a "train wreck" due to the increase in the number of methods that come one after another in the same line that occurs as more methods are chained together.</p>

        <span class="clickable11">Strings</span>
        <div id="showing11">
            <p>A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second in 1, and so on.</p>

        <span class="clickable12">Booleans</span>

        <span class="clickable13">Undefined</span>
        <div id="showing13">
            <p>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.</p>

        <span class="clickable14">NaN</span>
        <div id="showing14">
            <p>The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.</p>

        </div>
        <br>

        <span class="clickable15">Null</span>
        <div id="showing15">
            <p>The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.</p>

        <span class="clickable16">Alert</span>
        <div id="showing16">
            <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>

            <p> An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>

            <p> Note: The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the browser to read the message. Do not overuse this method, as it prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.

        <span class="clickable17">Comments</span>
        <div id="showing17">
            <p>Single-line comments are used to comment a part of a line or a full line of code in JavaScript. You can use it for either explaining the code or debugging (commenting out to prevent the execution by the browser). For a single-line comment,
                you have to write two forward slashes: // .</p>

            <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that allows web developers to add extra functionality to their websites. It is open source and provided for free under the MIT license. In recent years, jQuery has become the most popular JavaScript library used
